# Twitter_sentiment_analysis_using-NLP
Includes processing a raw data by cleaning it up, and then training on that cleaned data to predict the sentiment of a test data.
Clean the data by removing Stopwords, did Stemming and applied Label Encoding. Applied
countvectorizer on 1000 features,applied LR, got 90% accuracy.
Optimized by SVM, got 94% accuracy
